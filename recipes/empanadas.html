            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef;cook and stir
                    until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Stir in tomato sauce, sofrito, sazon, garlic, oregano, and pepper.
                    Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minute</li>
                <li>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch larger in diameter. Spoon about 1 tablespoon
                    meat mixture into the middle of each disk. Moisten the disk edges with water, fold in half over filling to
                    form a half-moon, and pinch to seal (or seal with a fork).</li>
                <li>Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Working in batches,
                    fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer to paper towels to drain. Enjoy!</li>
