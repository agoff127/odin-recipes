            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup lard</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons cold water</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped onion</li>
                    <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups sliced mushrooms</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>3 cups cooked chicken, chopped</li>
                    <li>2 carrots, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>2 stalks celery, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>2 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Cut in lard until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Divide dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Roll one ball out to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate. Roll out top crust and set aside.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C.)</li>
                <li>Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large saucepan. Blend in flour, salt, pepper, and onion. Gradually stir in chicken broth. Cook, constantly stirring, until smooth and thickened. In a separate pan, saut√© mushrooms in 3 tablespoons of butter, then stir into the saucepan. Stir in chicken, carrot, celery, and potatoes; continue to cook until potatoes and carrot are slightly softened, 5 to 7 minutes more. Mix well and pour into bottom pie crust. Cover with top crust, seal edges, and cut away excess dough. Make several small slits in top to allow steam to escape.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown, and filling is bubbly.</li>
            </ol>
